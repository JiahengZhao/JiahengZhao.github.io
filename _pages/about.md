I'm a Ph.D. engineer deeply immersed in the field of autonomous driving and robotics. My areas of expertise encompass Lidar/Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), 3D construction, computer vision, and sensor technologies. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience, I navigate the dynamic landscape of robotics. My mission is to unravel the potential of autonomous systems and contribute to their growth. This platform serves as a space to share insights and the latest developments in robotics, SLAM, computer vision, and sensor technologies. Join me in exploring the cutting edge of technology and innovation as we shape the future of robotics together.

Experience
======
I am currently a Senior Engineer at [<font color="black">Conigital Group</font>](https://conigital.org/) in Sydney, Australia, where I have dedicated 2 years to advancing technologies in SLAM, perception, and sensor fusion. In this role, I've developed Lidar/Camera-based mapping and localisation algorithms, tackled challenges in sensors data fusion, performed extrinsic calibration, and honed my skills in on-road object detection and segmentation.

Previously, I served as a Senior Localization and Navigation Algorithm Engineer at [<font color="black">UBTECH Research</font>](https://research.ubtrobot.com/home) in Shenzhen, China. My work centered on the development of cutting-edge SLAM, localization, and mapping algorithms. Noteworthy projects included crafting localization algorithms for quadruped robots, creating SLAM solutions for unmanned inspection vehicles within power stations, and pioneering autonomous exploration, mapping, and navigation algorithms for ultraviolet disinfection robots.

My academic journey is marked by two PhD pursuits. I conducted research at the Robotics Institute, University of Technology Sydney (UTS: RI), supervised by [<font color="black">Prof. Shoudong Huang</font>](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang) and [<font color="black">Dr. Liang Zhao</font>](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Liang.Zhao). My major area of focus was indoor/outdoor SLAM for mobile vehicles. Additionally, I pursued a PhD at the Beijing Institute of Technology, under the guidance of [<font color="black">Prof. Baoling Han</font>](https://me.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/jdkxjcb/jxsjjys/bssds18/b30885.htm), where I delved into SLAM techniques for multi-terrain wheeled/footed robots. These academic experiences laid the groundwork for my contributions to the field of robotics.

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->

<!-- How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
