This project is a personal endeavor accomplished with the collaboration of me and my two friends. They handled the mechanical and electronic aspects, while I took charge of all the software components.

The mower is integrated with rotational Lidar, camera, IMU, GPS, and Encoder, and is designed to:
* build maps for golf courses or parks,
* automatically plan paths and navigate to mowe lawn,
* detect and avoid collisions with peple, cars, or animals.

It can also be controlled by remote controller, besides operating on the mower.
