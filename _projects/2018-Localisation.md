This [<font color="black">project</font>](https://web-tools.uts.edu.au/projects/detail.cfm?ProjectId=PRO17-4324) aims to develop precise and robust localisation and mapping algorithms for [SIASUN](https://siasun.hk/)'s mobile robots.

My responsibilities include:
* Developing indoor localisation software.
* Developing multi-sensor fusion algorithm, including Lidar, RGB-D camera, encoder, and IMU.
