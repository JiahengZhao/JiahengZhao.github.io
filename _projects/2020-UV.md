This [<font color="black">project</font>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNjqwu12U1c) aims to develop a mobile robot which can autonomously explore indoor environment, build corresponding map and navigate in the map.

In this project, my responsibilies include:

- Responsible for map building task and disinfection area generalization.
- Developed self-exploring algorithm, which enables the robot to explore unknown environment.
 automatically and build the entire map for navigation.
- Developed disinfection area generation algorithm under the strategy of maximizing map coverage.
- Accomplished ROS based programming for various sensors. The disinfection robot equipped sensors including 2D lidar, RGB-D camera, ultrasound sensor, IMU and wheel odometer.
