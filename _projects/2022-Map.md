This project is associated with Smart UTE project and 5G Remote Control Project. I'm in charge of the following aspects:

- Large scale map building aided by GPU.
- Coloured map generation.
- Multiple sensors extrinsic calibration.
- Objects removal aided by deep learning.

Example: 3D Map - Created by 4 Lidars
