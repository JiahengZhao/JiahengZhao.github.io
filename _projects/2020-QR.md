This [<font color="black">project</font>](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2021/02/11/ubtech-reveals-robot-ox-on-the-most-watched-tv-show-on-earth/40419/) aims to develop a mobile robot which can autonomously explore indoor environment, build corresponding map and navigate in the map.

In this project, my responsibilies include:

- Responsible for 3D Lidar-based localization algorithm for Quadruped robot.
- Developed real-time multi-sensor fusion algorithm for stage performances. Including Lidar and IMU.
- Accomplished offline map building algorithm to construct the environment.
- Implemented the synchronization of dance command and localization function.
- Took part in the UWB-based localization algorithm and completed fusing UWB and IMU.
